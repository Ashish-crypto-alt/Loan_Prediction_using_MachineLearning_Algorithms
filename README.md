# Abstract : This project is to predict if a loan will get approved or not
A typial classification problem. A project I did for practicing data analytics skills and gaining better understanding of machine learning algorithms and concepts.

# Data Collection : Train_file_loan.csv and test_file_loan.csv are the data source files. (Semi-Clean Data available on Kaggle)
The png files are for data visualization All the rest csv files are the results files

# Libriries used : pandas, numpy , seaborn and matplotlib (For EDA analysis and Visulization) / Sklearn, sklearn Metrics, StratifiedKFold (to evaluate the models)  

# Data types for visualization :
(1) categorical : gender, married(yes,no), self_employed(yes,no), credit_history(0.0 , 1.0) (2) ordinal : dependent(1,2,3,4), education(gradute,not graduate ), property(rural,urban,semiurban) (3) numeral : it can be count : applicant income , loan amount.




# Model Selection : logistic regression , decision tree and random forest
StratifiedKFold to evaluate the models

# Results: Random Forest has the highest accuracy 0.80
